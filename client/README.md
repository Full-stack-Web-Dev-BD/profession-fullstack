I am looking for non-fancy prototype teaching tool whereby students submit a short (1-3 sentences) answer and then provide feedback on same answer from other student, then everyone receives feedback back. I think 




Page One- login with email and password, has a timer counting down time to log in. 
Page Two - Tells how many users are logged in, provides an instructor-drafted prompt question, provides text box to type answer. System randomly exchanges draft answers among participants. 
Page Three - Provides answer of another participant and text box for comments and feedback. 
Page Four: You receive your original draft back along with feedback from anonymous other. Functionality would have 
page 6 for instructor only- showing emails of everyone who participated.
